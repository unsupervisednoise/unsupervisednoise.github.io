Welcome to Unsupervised Noise, a blog dedicated to the intersection between music and deep learning, with an eye kept on art and AI in general.

In the last few years lots of thing are happening, and I thought that a website fully dedicated to this topic, with articles, reviews and tutorials could be of some interest.

This is site is curated by me, [Valerio Orlandini][valerio-orlandini], bioinformatician, musician and developer from Italy.

I hope you enjoy this journey!
