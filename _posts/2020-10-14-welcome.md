Welcome! This blog will bring you all the exciting news about deep learning applied to music composition, and sometimes to other forms of art. I will try to be both technically accurate and accessible to those who are interested in this topic but are not IT experts.

By the way, my name is Valerio Orlandini, I am an electroacoustic composer and bioinformatician from Italy. Nice to meet you!
